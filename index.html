      <h1>My name is Carpio "Redo", and I make websites.</h1>
      <p>I'm an independent consultant. My specialization is inclusive web development.</p>
      <p>
          My goal is to ensure that your content can reach any user, in any browsing
          context—regardless of the size of their device, or the combination of browsers
          and assistive technologies they use to experience the web.
